**What is Marijo1 ?**

Marijo1 is a **2 player No-Limit Texas Hold'em AI**, which runs with a regret minimization algorithm.

Marijo1 **does not take into account the different possible actions from the opponent** when making a prediction.

This makes it very fast, but should inherently prevent it from reaching super-human level.

**This AI is pretty strong, but not strong enough to beat good playing humans.**

**Its use cases are:**

    - Be a worthy opponent for any RL Model starting to learn

    - Provide a base strategy for other regret minimization algorithms

    - Provide a public benchmark for any developer wanting to test his AI against another one
    
    - Provide a good base for Marijo2

**What will be Marijo2?**

Marijo2 will be an AI working with the same constraint as Marijo1 (to not take into account the different possible actions from the opponent).

As Marijo1 was solely developped by playing against a human-being, Marijo2 will be tested against itself, with small tweakings, or new ideas, and replace the base version by the experimental one if the latter is better.

**Marijo1 is the algorithm that seems the most logical to me. Marijo2 will be the better AI empirically.**
